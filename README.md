# Simple Balance API

## Overview
This project implements a simple Express-based API to manage a balance through `GET` and `POST` requests. It is designed to demonstrate basic API development with Node.js using Express framework. The API allows you to retrieve the current balance and update it by posting events.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Development Notes
- The server will start running on port 8080. You can access the API at `http://localhost:8080`;
- This project does not connect to a database; all data is stored in memory and will be reset when the server restarts;
- The API is designed for demonstration purposes;
